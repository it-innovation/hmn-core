/**
 * A class representing a connection that an Agent (Human or Machine) has to an Edge
 * between the two. Edges are directional, and a Connection from the source Agent to the
 * destination/sink Agent encapsulates properties determining how they may interact with 
 * the destination/sink on the basis of properties like trust.
 * 
 * Similarly, Connection objects associated with the destination Agent encapsulates
 * properties determining how they may behave with regards to the interactions they receive.
 * 
 * This class includes trust and trustworthiness as explicit properties. Their use
 * warrants explanation, as the use of these properties depends on whether the connection
 * is for a SOURCE or SINK node of a directed edge.
 * 
 * From the perspective of a SOURCE node
 *   They have trust in the SINK node
 *   Their trust is based on the trustworthiness of the SINK node
 *   Their trust influences their interactions towards the sink along this edge and connection type, e.g., they may not even chose not to interact
 * From the perspective of the SINK node
 *   They have trust in the SOURCE node
 *   Their trust is based on the trustworthiness of the SOURCE node (as somebody interacting with them)
 *   Their trust influences how they may react to the incoming interaction from the SOURCE node
 * Therefore, if this is a SOURCE connection type
 *   Trust is associated with the SOURCE node
 *   Trustworthiness is associated with the SINK node
 * And, conversely, if this is a SINK connection type
 *   Trust is associated with the SINK node
 *   Trustworthiness is associated with the SOURCE node
 * @see Edge
 * @see Agent
